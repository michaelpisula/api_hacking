# API Hacking Project

This project is meant to allow to experiment with REST APIs, 
the goal is to inspect the presented API, analyze the problems
and refactor it to be RESTful.

A possible solution can be found in the solution branch.

## Setting up

The project can be run from Gitpod, after starting you need to 
make the 8080 port public.

A postman collection is provided with each of the implemented
APIs. To use the collection import into Postman, and create an
environment in Postman with a variable url and the value of the
address to the public port you create in gitpod.
